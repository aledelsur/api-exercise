# api-exercise
This project is an API with two endpoints.
Endpoint 1 - The client makes a POST request specifying a web page like www.google.com and the endpoint will open the web page and extract all the H1, H2, H3 and links from the web page.

Endpoint 2 - The client makes a GET request and it will retrieve from the database all the URLs stored with all the H1, H2, H3 and links associated with it.
